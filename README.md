# Atlanta_Traffic_Simulator_pygame

Atlanta Traffic Simulator is a basic frogger clone built using python and the pygame's 2D framework. 
It was built in the first few weeks of my bootcamp with DigitalCrafts. 
You select a vehicle and try to last as long as possible in Atlanta traffic. Don't hit another car!
Difficulty goes up as the clock ticks closer to rush hour.
The amount of "enemy" cars and their speed is randomly generated based on the counter.
Run the python file Atlanta_Traffic_Sim to begin using 'pythonw Atlanta_Traffic_Sim.py'.
