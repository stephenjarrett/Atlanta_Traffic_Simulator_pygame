# Atlanta_Traffic_Simulator_pygame

Atlanta Traffic Simulator is a basic frogger clone built using python and the pygame's 2D framework. 
It was built in the first few weeks of my bootcamp with DigitalCrafts. 
You select a vehicle and try to last as long as possible in Atlanta traffic. 
Difficulty goes up as the clock ticks closer to rush hour.
